> Originally I posted this to my dev.to profile in Nov, 2018; you can read it [here](https://dev.to/pickleat/add-an-emoji-favicon-to-your-site-co2) if you'd like. I decided to repost it on my blog, since I wrote it and all.

For my first post I thought I'd share a short little trick I learned that makes websites look better!  

For starters, if you don't know what a favicon is, don't fret! I didn't until recently. Its the small thumbnail on your tab. If you use Google Chrome, it looks like this:

I've been working on a project1 for CS50 for web-programming class. The assignment: build a book review website, using Flask and PostgreSQL. While I was working on it, I got bit miffed that my site wasn't looking very professional. I was using Bootstrap, for the ease of formatting, but that wasn't looking great, just a tad better than the default. I decided adding a favicon would help a bit, but I didn't want to mess with making a logo or finding a picture and scaling it, so I thought. Maybe an emoji would work? It did, fantastically! 

I decided it would be painless to find the emoji I wanted and then just add it to my `<head>` of my template.html. Here's how the code ended up looking:

This adds a great touch, and if a user is like me and has 15 tabs open at all times, the favicon, would help them find the correct page.

Here's how I did it:

1. Head to [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/)
2. Find your emoji.
3. Right-Click on the emoji style you prefer (I chose the Apple version)
4. Copy the link and insert into your `<head>` tag like so: `<link rel="icon" href="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/apple/155/books_1f4da.png">` OR if you are using [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/) you can download the file and save as `favicon.ico` into your static folder and it will inject it for you!.


And you're done! I was using flask for this project, so I put this in the layout page and it dynamically puts in on any template that has the `{% extends "layout.html" %}` at the top of the .html doc.

Here's how it looks!

As you can see, I'm still testing on a localhost, haven't quite finished the project yet, but it'll be on my [profile site](https://pickleat.github.io/), and its own [repo](https://github.com/pickleat/BookReviewSite) as well.
