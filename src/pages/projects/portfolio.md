> Problem: I needed to update my portfolio.

At some point last year I wanted to try Gatsby for the first time, so I decided to build a portfolio on using Github Pages and Gatsby. I followed the starter tutorial and built a blog with Markdown. It was a pretty good introduction to Gatsby by both getting acquainted with the technology without being overly complicated.

I was itching to design my own site, so I could have more of my own fingerprints on it.
