For about two weeks I've been applying for jobs. Sadly, the startup I was working at just didn't work out. I am super bummed it didn't work out, but that's how things go sometimes. Anyway, I've been posting on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pickleat) that I'm looking around and such and I had a friend offer to do a mock interview.
