        <p><b>A little about me:</b><br />I'm passionate about building things on the web that people 
            actually enjoy using. I love specialty coffee, listening to music, and soccer. If you care
            what I think you can read my <a href="blog/">blog</a>. If you want to see what I've built 
            check out my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, if you're interested in hiring me, check 
            out my resume, or if you want to work together, get in <a href='/contact'>touch!</a>
        </p>
        <p>Currently I'm building <a href="https://coffeecodex.co/">CoffeeCodex.co</a>. A site for coffee-
        lovers like myself to track all the different origins of coffee they've had.</p>
