Overview: 
    For my Project0 I decided to take this opportunity to make a portfolio website. I spent a lot of time learning how to utilize the power of Bootstrap. I created a landing page, and then links for more info About me, Portfolio, How to Connect, as well as a fun 404 Error page. I took a lot of inspiration for the layout and pages from AliSpit.tel, shoutout to her if she happens to read this!
Index.Html/Home
    This is my home landing page, with a navbar (on all pages) as well as a profile photo and a short about me. I am anticipating getting real headshots taken soon. But I had to use the best picture I could find for the time being. 
About
    Intended to give a bit more information about me. I used this page to put the timeline of where I've lived in my life for the Table requirement of the assignment. I will make this more of a professional resume as my experience allows. Point was to keep it short and sweet and let people know what I'm interested in. 
Projects:
    Utilized the Bootstrap 4 Cards to create cards for my projects. I don't have very many, but in the future I'd like to have it organized by type of project or language.
Connect:
    Wanted a simple page that had links to get in touch with me. In the future I'll probably add a portion for any freelance work I happen to be open to.
