Sadly, the startup I was working at just didn't work out. I am super bummed it didn't work out, but that's how things go sometimes.

I just cracked under the pressue. I wasn't that I don't know how to reverse a list.

You can call it anything you want. Common practice is to call the <code>array</code> the plural of whatever is contained in your array, and the singular item for each computation. I'll be honest, lots of this clicked for me by using a <code>forEach()</code> for a long time, instead. The difference between them is <code>.map()</code> returns an updated array. So in the example above, the numbers array has been rewritten with each value plus one. But if you wanted to keep your original numbers array, you would simply declare it to a new array like so <code>let numbersPlusOne = numbers.map(numb=> numb+1)</code>.</p>\n<h2>Array.filter()</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\">from MDN:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main difference here, is that whatever condition you pass, will give you a mutated array of all the items that meet that condition.\nFor Example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\nnumbers = numbers.filter(numb=> numb % 2 == 0)\nconsole.log(numbers)\n// will be [2,4]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whatever condition you pass will be checked for each item in the array and it will be added to the new array and returned.</p>\n<h2>Array.reduce()</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce\">from MDN:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one is just a bit more complicated, because there are more arguments. But in its simplest form you can take an array and perform the same function on each element to recieve back a single value. Back to our numbers array</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]\nnumbers.reduce( (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue )\nconsole.log(numbers)\n// 15\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind the computation you do will be done on each item in the array, and the <code>accumulator</code> is the running total. There are also optional arguments of <code>currentIndex</code> and <code>array</code> that follow the currentvalue (before the arrow function) but I won't get into those here.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>"}
